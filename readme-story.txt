You wake up in your bed.

The alarm failed to ring.

You stand up and notice that the door is open.

In the living room, you see your father laying dead in a pool of blood.

Your mother hung by the noose of a rope to the ceilng.

You find a note, written in ink : "Life's a bitch. Get the best of her."

You recollect that your father had been worried and your mother arguing with him about a loanshark, something about a meeting at a junction.

Stricken with grief you venture out to find 

Level 1:
You are out in the suburbs of your house. You have to find the junction. On the way you'll come across several violent dogs, cats, and rats as you explore roads. On the way you'd notice several rats crawling over a brochure of a rock climbing gym.

Level 2:
After coming across the junction you have three options. North, East or West. North would head to the nightclub. West would take you to the mall. East would take you to the park.  If you head east you find nothing. If you head North you'd find nothing. If you head West you'd notice that a gym opened up in the mall that you've never seen before. Throughout the area there are people some of them would try to attack you and some that won't. One of them whispers in your ear : "I've never seen a fires so tall, I would give my soul to the speakers by the beach. *Sigh* I only had a daughter."

Level 3:
In the gym to the left there are rusty weights, straight up ahead are treadmills set at high speed but no one is running on them. To the right there's the rock climbing gym. Only the rock climbing gym would progress the story but in the room with the treadmills you find a note: "Remember what the Bible says: He who is without sin, cast the first rock. And I shall smoketh it."

Level 4: You are to climb the up the wall and as you do you notice hot lava starts to pour from the top and by chance you make it to the top. On the very top you find a slab of rock. Someone calls you and tells you that you've to sacrifice a dog in order to stop the murderous rage that has stricken the city. If you head right you'll find a bunch of gym equipment and up ahead there's a little puppy. To the left there's a gun. If you find the gun you have the choice to kill yourself with it. If you find a rope you'll have the option to either strangle yourself or the dog.

The ending: You wake up realizing you've murdered your younger sister or you never wake up.
