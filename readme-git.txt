1. We are ignoring .class files because they are useless. They are compiled .java files and any computer can produce them.
2. .ctxt files are for BlueJ and are most likely precompiled so no one needs them.
3. mtj.tmp/ are useless because they are for mobile tools for Java, possibly generatable and we aren't making a mobile application.
4. .jars, .wars, .ears are compiled binary files that are computer generated so they could be generated anywhere.
5. .idea because they are unique to people who use IntelliJ, its generated by IntelliJ and may conflict between IntelliJ setups.
